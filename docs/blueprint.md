## Core Features:

- Revenue Tracker: Display real-time data on money made today. Update Firestore in the background with completed transactions.
- Order Tracker: Count and display total orders received for the day in real time.
- Live Order Feed: Present a live-updating list of current orders with status indicators (Waiting, Cooking, Done). Each status links to data inside the Firestore.
- Interactive Side Menu: Provide a navigation menu for accessing 'Menu', 'Staff', 'Kitchen', and 'Stock' management sections. The menu highlights a tool that uses a large language model (LLM) to provide personalized operational advice depending on which button is pressed.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant orange (#FF8C00) to evoke feelings of warmth, appetite, and energy.
- Background color: Light, desaturated orange (#FFF2E6) for a bright and inviting feel.
- Accent color: Yellow (#FFD700) for highlights and CTAs.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a sans-serif font that brings warmth to a modern look.
- Use clean, easily recognizable icons for menu items and navigation. Consider food-related icons or simplified representations of dashboard functions.
- Design the layout to feature top section boxes prominently. Side menu remains fixed for easy navigation. Ensure content areas remain uncluttered, to optimize scannability and make the game interface easy to understand.
- Add smooth, subtle animations on data updates. On hovering a dish, apply a smooth increase in elevation (z-axis). Acknowledge actions and status changes (order placed, order complete, item out of stock) with pleasant, gentle sound cues.
